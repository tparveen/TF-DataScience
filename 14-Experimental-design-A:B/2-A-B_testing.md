## Assignments

For each of the following questions, outline how you could use an A/B test to find an answer. Be sure to identify all five key components of an A/B test we outlined above.

* Does a new supplement help people sleep better?
* Will new uniforms help a gym's business?
* Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?
* If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?

The 5 components are 

1) Control version and test version

2) Samples

3) Hypothesis

4) Outcomes

5) Metrics/measurements


### Does a new supplement help people sleep better?

1) The controlled version of the A/B test would be to monitor sleep without any supplement or with supplements that are already in use since the experiment is about "new" supplement. The test version will be experimenting with the new supplement

2) Sample: The samples are divided in 2 groups. One group (Group A) will not take the new supplement. The other group (Group B) will take the new supplement. 

3) Hypothesis: The new supplement help people sleep better than no supplement
The new supplement help people sleep better than its predecessor

4) Outcomes: If the two groups were similar in age, gender and lifestyle, then Group B should have a better sleep than Group A. As we define better (in terms of number of hours, number of sleep interruption, etc). If all things are similar, and the results are not better than Group A, that means that the new supplement does not help sleep better

5) Metrics and measurements: The 2 groups of samples are of similar age, same gender, and similar lifestyle. There should be a certain period of study, for example a period of 28 days. Its takes time for a supplement to work and its different for different individuals. Therefore its better to give it some adjustment period. During this time the 2 groups lifestyle should be similar - for example one can't be more active than the other because that can help them sleep and will not give us a good indication of how the supplement helped. 
There should be metric as to what "Better" means? Better should be defined by hours of sleep, Rem cycles, uninterrupted sleep etc.
The metrics by which "Better" was defined should be measured to see if the hypothesis is rejected or not.


### Will new uniforms help a gym's business?

1) This question is very vague. What does Gym's business mean? does that mean getting new customers? retaining existing customers? retaining employees? reducing employee churn? Once that is figured out - The A/B test would be to see if the gym will have a controlled version and a test version of test. 
Lets assume its asking a new uniform attracts new customers or not

2) Sample: The samples are divided in 2 groups. Does the gym have more than one facility? If so, then Maybe have one facility (Group A) will have employees with the existing uniform. The other facility (Group B) will have employees with new uniform. 

3) Hypothesis: The new uniform attracts new customers
The new uniform does not make a difference in new customer joining the Gym.

4) Outcomes: If the two groups were similar in age, gender, working hours, personality, then Group B should attract new customers than Group A. We could also have secondary outcomes such as existing customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, reduce employee churn etc.

5) Metrics and measurements: The 2 groups of samples are of similar age, gender, working hours, and personality. There should be a certain period of study, for example a period of a few months. People don't go to the gym everyday. Seasonal time should also be avoided. For example in the new year everyone goes to the gym to start their new years resolution. Those times should be avoided to do the study. Similarly, holidays should be avoided because people either drop off and stop going to the gym and waits for new years to start.
