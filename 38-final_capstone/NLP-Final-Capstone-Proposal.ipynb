    "# Final Capstone: Detecting Fake news\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the problem you are attempting to solve?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is about detecting fake news using NLP and classification models. The data is collected from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data. the data consists of  \n",
    "\n",
    "title: the title of a news article\n",
    "author: author of the news article\n",
    "text: the text of the article\n",
    "label: a label that marks the article as potentially real or fake\n",
    "    1: FAKE\n",
    "    0: REAL\n",
    "    \n",
    "### How is your solution valuable?\n",
    "Today, we get news from all over the place. Most people will tell you that they get their news from facebook or some blog online. News is very powerful and its important that the integrity of news is verified and protected so its important to see if news that we get from certain places are fake or real.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### What is your data source and how will you access it?\n",
    "I will be getting the data from Kaggle and use that for now. Time permitting, I may use the onion to get some fake news and other articles as real news and use my model on that. But for now I will be getting the data from Kaggle and split it into train and test dataset\n",
    "    \n",
    "### What techniques from the course do you anticipate using?\n",
    "I will be using all techniques learned so far of data cleaning and data visulaization. In addition, I will be using NLP and various NLP techniques to clean and tokenize the text and various classification models on the text to see how accurate the model will be to detecting fake news.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do you anticipate to be the biggest challenge you’ll face?\n",
    "- I think data cleaning will be challenging \n",
    "- Lots and lots of tokens so memory problems as well as runtime and processing powers\n",
    "- overfitting models and hyperparameter tuning\n",
