    "- To complete this assignment, submit a link to a Jupyter notebook containing your solutions to the following tasks:\n",
    "- Try to model the result of a coin toss. In your model, include any features that you think important in explaining the result. Discuss with your mentor about the pros and cons of adding too many features into your model.\n",
    "- If you ever used Netflix, you should already have realized that it provides some recommendations for you to watch. In data science, this is an example of the so-called recommendations systems. \n",
    "- Read this nontechnical blog post of Netflix about how they model their recommendations systems. Then, derive the features they use in their recommendations engines and discuss what else can be incorporated into this model."

    "And there are many others...\n",
    "Too many features force us to collect more experment trials. Because, we need to determine the values for each factors and the more factors we have the more unknowns to determine. So, we may want to include only the most relevant factors into the model."
