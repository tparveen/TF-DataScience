### Assignments

For each of the following scenarios, 
- call out the potential biases in the proposed experiment. 
- Do your best to try to discover not only the bias, but the initial design. 

There is plenty of room for interpretation here, so make sure to state what assumptions you're making.

* You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
* You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.
* You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
* You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.


1. You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.

Potential biases:
 - Bias in assignment to condition: February being a cold month, people may less interested in bathing suite at that time of the year. May would have more interest since it is right before summer or summer in some places. 
 - Contextual bias: Depending on where (location) you are advertising. People that lives in places near water will be more interested in the email than people who do not live near water. Also, seasonal and holidays may effect this too. February is not really a vacation time - May is a time to take some time off and go on vacation - e.g., memorial day as a time for vacation  
 - Observer bias:  There could be observer bias depending on who you pick to feature on the advertisement. For example, a female model with a bikini will probably get more more hits on the email than a male model will. 
 - Sampling/selection Bias: Depending on where you are getting the samples from - people in Australia may be more interested in bathing suit than people in Alaska. 

2. You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.

Potential biases:
- Bias in assignment to condition: The samples are taken from an anxiety clinic. After all it is an anxiety clinic - These samples should not be compared to general population. They are in the clinic because they already have some anxiety disorder. Of course they will have higher rate.
- Contextual bias: Other patients will have influence on anyone who comes to clinic. Just seeing other anxious patience could raise one's anxiety significantly 
- Sampling or selection bias:  The samples from here will have higher anxiety. No one ever goes to an anxiety clinic with low anxiety.

3. You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.

Potential biases:
 - Sampling/selection bias: Depending on where the billboard is. If it is placed at a place where the ad is more catered towards people living nearby and traveling on that road everyday, then the website visit will increase by those people but will not be an indication of the effectiveness of the ad.
 - Observer bias: A billboard is right there on people's face so people can see it and whether they like it or not, its enough to generate curiosity for people to visit the site immediately. 


4. You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.

Potential biases:
 - Bias in assignment to condition: A loyalty program is attractive because of its benefit that it provides. These loyalty benefits are long term. A week is not enough to see much of a change unless some incentives are provided as short term benefit. Over time, as customers becomes loyal and more know about the benefit, the number of visits may change, but a week time is too short and the result of that is biased.
 - Observer bias: A loyalty program is for Loyal customers. Launching that without providing short term benefit does not show loyalty on the organization's part, therefore visitors won't be loyal to visit either.
