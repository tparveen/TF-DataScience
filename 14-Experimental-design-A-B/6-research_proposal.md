https://courses.thinkful.com/dsbc-exp-des-ab-test-v1/checkpoint/6

Look back to the potential experiments in the previous assignment. For one of those experiments, write up the essential points of a research proposal for an improved version of that experiment.


#### The problem

How to improve public relation with the Jedi and people of different plannets? 
The Jedi are supposed to keep order in place so haveing good relation with the Jedi and having them as part of decision making will result in unnecesary uprising, war and other chaos in the galaxy.


#### The potential solution

Having representative who are personable and diplomatic to visit the different planets and educate people what the Jedi are all about and eliminate any misunderstaning of misinformation.


#### The method of testing the solution

* Identify how many planets are there in total
* Identify how many friendly and non-friendly planets are there
* Seperate the friendly and the non friendly platnets and identify a handful of friendly and non friendly planets as samples (Group A and Group B)
* Send Jar Jar Bing as the representative to all the planets (Group A and Gorup B) 
* Jar Jar Bing spends a certain amount of time (say a week) in each planet and uses the same procedure and the same message to champion the Jedi in both groups of planets.
* This is done about 3 times over a period of one  year and in between visits surveys are collected see how people in planets in group A and Group B feels about the Jedi. 
* After one year, if Group B (unfriendly planet) peoples' attitude in favor of the Jedi has not increased by 20%, and Group A (friendly planet) peoples' attitude in favor of the Jedi has not increased by 30%, then the conclustion would be Jar Jar Bing is not a good representative to speak for the Jedi and will have to find someone else. Otherwise, the conclusion would be that Jar Jar Bind is an effective representative.
