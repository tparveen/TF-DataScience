### Challenge: Evaluate an experiment analysis

 Read the following descriptions of an experiment and its analysis, identify the flaws in each, and describe what you would do to correct them 

1. The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.


Flaws: These are captured driod so the anger slogan will have more effect on the already scared droid. It does not mean that its an overall effective slogan. The Together slogan may be less fierce for the captured driod and they can exercise their free will without fear.
Correction: Don't use captured droid. Use it on free will droid and see how many converts


2. In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.

Flaws: The flaws in this experiments are selecting 4 friendly and 4 unfriendly planets. Its an unfair comparision.
Correction: Make 2 of Jar Jar Bink's planet unfriendly and 2 of Windu's planet friendly.


3. A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report.

Flaws: HR employee lack randomization. They are concentrated on three countries and these countries could be very favorable to those workers.
Correction: Randomize the HR employees and spread them out to different countries like the IT workers


4. When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.

Flaws: There are people who may not opt in so their data is not part of the result. How do we know what their activity levels were before? what are we comparing to?  
Correction: Doing an A/B test would be a better option. Have samples wihtout any bias who uses the app and those who does not and compare.


5. To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.

Flaws: There is no randomizaton in the versions of the tests at all. They are all stacked together one after the other - so it is possible that the students who took version B are all very good and were clustered together so they scored well.
Correction: Provided all three tests are created in consistent manner and all things equal on the tests, shuffle the tests so all three versions are randomly placed and each student will have an equal chance of getting any one of them.
